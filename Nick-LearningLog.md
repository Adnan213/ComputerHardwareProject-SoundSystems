<h1>Things i learnt</h1>
<p>From this project i learned how to apply some of my new and still improving knowledge of html code and very, very, very, limited knowledge of CSS. I also learned a lot about my assigned component, Sound Systems. Although i already had a solid grasp on its functionality i was not so clued in on the history of the component. I learned how formatting and organizing your code can make your life a whole lot easier when it comes to seeing your errors or simply finding places to add more content.</p>
