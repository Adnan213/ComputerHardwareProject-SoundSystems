<h3 id="history">Intro/Brief History</h3>

<p>Audio devices are used in computers to register information through input devices and then play them through <br>
  speakers or other output devices.  The first recorded audio device created was in 1876 by Alexander Graham Bell <br>
  and was called the electronic loudspeaker. It was capable of basic reproduction of speech. It was refined a year <br>
  later by Thomas Edison who invented the phonograph, capable of recording and reproducing sounds. Audio also has 3 <br>
  basic elements frequency, intensity and timbre. <br>
  <ul>
    <li> Frequency: how fast the vibrations are and the bass <br>
    <li> Intensity: how loud the volume is <br>
    <li> Timbre: the quality of the sound ( depends on the sound card)<br>
    <li> The human ear can only listen from 20-20,000 which is measured Hz/s. The sounds intensity depends on the energy of <br>
the sound which is measured in decibel ( dB )
  </ul>

<h3 id="general">General Information</h3>
<p>One main component is called the device drivers, it's a small computer device(hardware) which directly informs<br>
  the computer how to access and use all devices attached thus including the sound cards, some specific<br>
   headphones and/or speaker may require their own personal device driver then connects via USB.</p>
<p>Another main component for audio devices is the <strong>sound card</strong> it's a small slot inside your motherboard then <br>
  comes out as a 3.5 mm jack. The quality of the audio depends on your sound card, as well as speakers and <br>
  mics. Before sound cards invented pc’s were capable of making <i>beep</i> noises although they could change the <br>
  frequency but they couldn't change the volume or create other sounds. The sounds card job is too change <br>
  frequency and the intensity and the timbre and create all kinds of sounds in any type of volume with however<br>
  the quality you like. Now a days they could 3d audio for 1080p hd games with very good quality. It can also <br>
  capture sound and record sound</p>

   <h4> a Sound Card, the main processor of sound related functions in a computer. As shown above. </h4>
   <p>One last important component is that there is also an integrated amplifier which is basically like a receiver but without <br>
     AM/FM tuner. They can be accompanied by a /seperate AM/FM tuner but they don't have too . It combines either a 2 channel or <br>
     multichannel amp with a pre amp amplifier to select specific audio components and operating tone controls<br>
There are 2 types of audio devices input and output, both work together in order to create a full audio system, but are different<br>
in processing from each other.

<br>
<p id="in">
<strong>Input:</strong> <br>
<br>
Input devices are used to send information to the computer for it to be processed for an example a mouse could be<br>
used to “click” on certain websites to access information. When talking about audio devices we normally call input<br>
devices here microphones or anything of the sort. In general audio devices are used to capture sound some audio output<br>
devices can act as input devices to capture produced sound like microphones and any other digital musical instrument.<br>
There are some differences between different audio devices but they all share one common element which is the diaphragm.<br>
This is the main element in all microphones and audio recording devices. The sound waves are caught by the diaphragm, <br>
and this causes small vibrations which are then transferred into an electrical current, or other signals (wireless mics).<br>
The type of electrical current produced depends on the mic or type of audio recording device, but the majority of the time<br>
it is through a coil and a magnet, somewhat similar to what is found in speakers. The quality of the diaphragm, and the <br>
elements used to convert it into an electrical signal all play a part in the quality of the sounds registered, and which<br>
is what differentiates high quality and low quality mics.</p>

<h3>For example, a Microphone</h3>

<p id="out"><strong>Output:</strong><br>
<br>An output device would receive data and display it or produce it or project it through  speakers, headphones,<br>
or basically anything that produces electronic sound in the computer. Basically in the computer there are electronic <br>
waves which are produced in the computer core (CPU, Motherboard) and are sent to the output device. For this example <br>
we can say its a speaker. In the speaker the devices there are tasked with having to transfer those electrical signals<br>
to audible sounds (sound waves). This is done using 2 types of magnets, a stationary one, and an electromagnet. <br>
The electric sounds sent through the computer flow through the electromagnet, (a coil), and the stationary magnet <br>
reverse the flow of the electricity. (magnet is stationary. This is done by coiling the electromagnet around the magnet.<br>
Because the waves are being reversed constantly (north and south poles of the stationary magnet) this creates vibrations<br>
which are then amplified by a special cone (thin material) so that it is loud enough to hear.<br>
Different speakers have different size cones which is what produces different variety, quality and power of sounds.<br>
This is why larger speakers produce louder noises, but may lack the sophistication of a smaller speaker, <br>
struggling to make higher pitched sounds. This is why there is such a variety of sound systems, since some are used for music,<br>
while others are just used for speaking.
