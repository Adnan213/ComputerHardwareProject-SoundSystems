<h4> ^Sound Card^ </h4>
<h3>Brief History of Sound Systems</h3>
<p>Audio devices are used in computers to register information and then play them through speakers or<br> other output devices.
The first recorded audio device created was in 1877 by Thomas Edison and was <br>called "the phonograph".
It was capable of very basic audio recording and playback,
and since then<br> technology has progressed very far in terms of sophistication and processing ability.</p>

<p>One main component is called the device drivers, it's a small computer program which directly informs<br>
  the computer how to access and use all devices attached thus including the sound cards, some specific<br>
   headphones and/or speaker may require their own personal device driver then connects via USB.</p>

<p>Another main component for audio devices are sound cards it's a small slot inside your motherboard then<br>
  comes out as a 3.5 mm jack. The quality of the audio depends on your sound card. </p>
<p>There are 2 types of audio devices input and output, both work together in order to create a full audio<br>
   system, but are different in processing from each other.<br>
<br>
Input: <br>
input devices are used to send information to the computer for it to be processed for an example a mouse<br>
could be used to “click” on certain websites to access information another example<br>
<br>
Output:<br>
An output device would receive data and display it or produce it  or project it through any thing connected<br>
 via the various ports from speakers to headphones basically anything that produces or processes sound.
