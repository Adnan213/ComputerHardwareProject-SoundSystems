<h3 id="history">Brief History of Sound Systems</h3>

<p>Audio devices are used in computers to register information and then play them through speakers or<br> other output devices.
The first recorded audio device created was in 1877 by Thomas Edison and was <br>called "the phonograph".
It was capable of very basic audio recording and playback,
and since then<br> technology has progressed very far in terms of sophistication and processing ability.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="general">General Information</h3>
<p>One main component is called the device drivers, it's a small computer program which directly informs<br>
  the computer how to access and use all devices attached thus including the sound cards, some specific<br>
   headphones and/or speaker may require their own personal device driver then connects via USB.</p>

   <h4> a Sound Card, the main processor of sound related functions in a computer. As shown above. </h4>
<p>Another main component for audio devices are sound cards it's a small slot inside your motherboard then<br>
  comes out as a 3.5 mm jack. The quality of the audio depends on your sound card. </p>
<p>There are 2 types of audio devices input and output, both work together in order to create a full audio<br>
   system, but are different in processing from each other.<br></p>
<br>
<p id="in">
Input: <br>
<br>
input devices are used to send information to the computer for it to be processed for an example a mouse<br>
could be used to “click” on certain websites to access information another example<br></p>

<p id="out">Output:<br>
<br>An output device would receive data and display it or produce it or project it through  speakers, headphones,<br>
or basically anything that produces electronic sound in the computer. Basically in the computer there are electronic <br>
waves which are produced in the computer core (CPU, Motherboard) and are sent to the output device. For this example <br>
we can say its a speaker. In the speaker the devices there are tasked with having to transfer those electrical signals<br>
to audible sounds (sound waves). This is done using 2 types of magnets, a stationary one, and an electromagnet. <br>
The electric sounds sent through the computer flow through the electromagnet, (a coil), and the stationary magnet <br>
reverse the flow of the electricity. (magnet is stationary. This is done by coiling the electromagnet around the magnet.<br>
Because the waves are being reversed constantly (north and south poles of the stationary magnet) this creates vibrations<br>
which are then amplified by a special cone (thin material) so that it is loud enough to hear.<br>
Different speakers have different size cones which is what produces different variety, quality and power of sounds.<br>
This is why larger speakers produce louder noises, but may lack the sophistication of a smaller speaker, <br>
struggling to make higher pitched sounds. This is why there is such a variety of sound systems, since some are used for music,<br>
while others are just used for speaking.
